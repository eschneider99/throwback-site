                    Amycakes opened in August of 2009 in downtown Springfield, moving to the Walnut Street location in
                    August of 2014. Specializing in made-from-scratch cakes and cupcakes, pies, cookies, cake truffles
                    and cinnamon rolls, Amycakes is a locally-owned, family business. Everything is made-from-scratch so
                    it tastes as moist, flavorful and delicious as it looks!

                <p>
                    Amy has loved to bake all her life, and as a child loved baking with her Grandma. During her years
                    in college she found herself tweaking recipes and baking at all hours of the night. The most
                    rewarding part was finding hungry friends to test the finished product â€” and they weren't hard to
                    find! She graduated from Drury in 2008 with an Arts Administration degree, and decided baking was
                    the only thing she could see herself doing for the rest of her life. It's an art form and a science,
                    and she'll never grow tired of creating the perfect dessert! Flavor is the most important element to
                    Amy. When she's not living at the bakery, Amy enjoys quality time with family, friends, her husband,
                    Gabe (business owner and glass-maker at Springfield Hot Glass), and their two vicious fluffballs of
                    dogs, Charlie and Cupcake. They welcomed their first "Babycake" in January of 2017.
