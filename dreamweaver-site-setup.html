            <h2>The Site Setup Dialog</h2>

            <p>
                The Manage Sites dialog box is your gateway into various Dreamweaver site functions. From this dialog box, <br>
                you can initiate the process for creating a new site, editing an existing site, duplicating a site, <br>
                removing a site, or importing or exporting a site’s settings. <br>

                To set up and manage a site, use the Site > New Site, or Site > Manage Sites dialogs. <br>

                Click the <b>New Site</b> button to create a new Dreamweaver site. <br>
                Then specify the name and location for your new site in the <b>Site Setup</b> dialog box. <br>

            </p>

            <h2>Site Settings</h2>

            <p>
                In the Site Name text box, enter a name for your site. <br>
                This name appears in the Files panel and in the Manage Sites dialog box; <b>it does not appear in the browser.</b> <br>

                In the Local Site Folder text box, specify the folder you identified earlier— <br>
                the folder on your computer where you want to store the local version of your site files. <br>
                Click the folder icon to the right of the text box to browse to the folder. <br>
                This folder location is where you keep the working copies of web pages on your local computer. <br>

                Click save. <br>

            </p>

            <h2>Best practices for naming files and folders</h2>

            <p>
                Follow these general guidelines for naming files and folders: <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>File and folder names in websites should never contain spaces or any of the following characters: /\?%*:|">.</li>
                    <li>Although other special characters are permitted, it is better to confine yourself to alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores</li>
                    <li>Most file and folder names end up as part of a web page's URL, so keep them short, but meaningful. Long URLs are difficult for users to remember and type into browsers on a mobile device.</li>
                    <li>Stick to lowercase letters for file and folder names to avoid file not found issues. Most web servers are Linux –based, which are case-sensitive.</li>
                </ul>
